def calculate_ages():
    # Input the total age of the 3 players
    total_age = int(input())
    
    # Let the age of players X and Y be 'a'
    # The age of player Z will then be 'a + 10'
    # So, total_age = a + a + (a + 10) = 3a + 10
    # This gives us a = (total_age - 10) / 3
    age_x_y = (total_age - 10) // 3
    age_z = age_x_y + 10
    
    # Print the ages
    print(age_x_y)  # Age of Player X
    print(age_x_y)  # Age of Player Y
    print(age_z)    # Age of Player Z
